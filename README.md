# LLM-Powered Slack Bot
### Overview
- This Slack bot is an AI-powered researcher designed to assist users by scraping the web and providing answers based on their queries.
- This uses DuckDuckGo and Serper.dev to provide real-time data sources for the LLM to use as context for inference.
- Leveraging a large language model (LLM), the bot can efficiently gather information from various online sources and deliver concise, informative summaries directly within your Slack workspace.
